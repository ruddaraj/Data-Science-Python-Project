# OVERVIEW

This is my data analytics project, where I analysed data related job postings and information such as salaries and skills needed for each job. Through this project, I hoped to further improve my data analytics skills and expand my knowledge on certain libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. I also wanted to find insights on which skills were most in demand and highest paying for data related roles. I found this Data from Luke Barousse's python course, where I learned the basic Data analytic skills and was able to create my own data visualizations from the dataset. 

# QUESTIONS
  These are the questions that I intended to answer through data visualization
  - What are the most in demand skills for Data Analysts
  - How do the skills demanded change over the course of a year.
  - What are the median salaries for the most frequent skills found in job postings
  - What are the most optimal skills to learn to get a high paying role in a data role.

# Tools Used
  - Python (libraries)
      - Pandas. Used to clean, filter, and manipulate dataframes in order to create visualizations
      - MatPlotLib. Used to create basic visualizations that can answer some of the questions above and give insights into the job market.
      - Seaborn. Used to create more advanced visualizations that can offer more visually appealling visualizations and offer more layers of information
  - Jupyter notebook
      - Used to write python scripts and compare outputs of dataframes and visualizations
  - VSCode
      - The main IDE I Used to run python scripts
  - Git/GIthub
      - Used to share my project
