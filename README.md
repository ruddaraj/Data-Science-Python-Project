OVERVIEW
  This is my small personal data analytics project, where I analysed Data related job postings and related information such as salaries and skills needed for each job. Through this project, I hoped to further improve my data analytics skills and expand my knowledge on certain libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. I also wanted to find insights on which skills were most in demand and highest paying for data related roles. I found this Data from Luke Barousse's python course, where I learned the basic Data analytic skills and was able to create my own data visualizations from the dataset. 

QUESTIONS
  These are the questions that I intended to answer through data visualization
  - What are the most in demand skills for Data Analysts
  - How do the skills demanded change over the course of a year.
  - What are the highest paid skills, and what are the median salaries for the most in demand skills
  - What are the most optimal skills to learn to get a high paying role.

Tools Used
  - Python (libraries)
      - Pandas. Used to clean, filter, and sort dataframes in order to create visualizations
      - MatPlotLib. Used to create basic visualizations that can answer some of the questions above.
      - Seaborn. Used to create more advanced visualizations that can offer more advanced visual aspects, and offer more information
  - Jupyter notebook
      - Used to write python scripts and compare outputs of dataframes and visualizations
  - VSCode
      - The main IDE I Used to run python scripts
  - Git/GIthub
      - Used to share my project
